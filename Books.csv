26597,The Oxford Book of Legal Anecdotes (Oxford Paperbacks),"By Gilbert, Michael","The law has captured the public's attention and imagination for centuries, with its servants demonstrating time and again their fallibility.  A former lawyer and celebrated crime writer, Michael Gilbert has compiled a vastly entertaining collection of over three hundred fifty anecdotes about legal goings-on over the past two hundred fifty years, and about the individuals who have won distinction in the legal profession. Drawn from the reminiscences of lawyers, criminals, witnesses, and clerks, these irresistibly readable stories present the foibles as well as the authority of judges and other legal practitioners.     We find many celebrated legal battles retold here, including Edward Carson's cross-examination of Oscar Wilde and Clarence Darrow's defense of J.T. Scopes for teaching the theory of evolution.  We also discover countless less-familiar treasures such as the story of the letter received by Judge Benjamin Cardozo which said: ""I read in the newspapers that you are a liberal judge. Will you send me ten dollars as I'm really very hard up.""      Gilbert has arranged the entries alphabetically by the name of their principal subject.  He also includes headnotes which set the context and describe each subject's occupation (i.e. ""judge"", ""attorney general"") and a useful note which explains the differences between the British, European, and American legal systems."," Medical , Hematology",Oxford University Press,"Friday, December 1, 1989",0,0

Furthermore, the complicated equations and lengthy proofs we usually identify as math are no more the essence of math than a musical score is a Beethoven symphony.

By looking at the universe through mathematical eyes, we have discovered a great secret: nature's patterns are clues to the deep regularities that govern the way the world works.Mathematics is to nature as Sherlock Holmes is to evidence. It can look at a single snowflake and deduce the atomic structure of ice crystals; it can start with a violin string and uncover the existence of radio waves. And mathematics still has the power to open our eyes to new and unsuspected regularities: the secret structure of a cloud or the hidden rhythms of the weather.Nature's Numbers will equip you with a mathematician's eyes.

Then his youngest child, straight out of high school, joined the U.S. Marine Corps. Written in alternating voices by eighteen-year-old John and his father, Frank, Keeping Faith takes readers in riveting fashion through a family’s experience of the U.S. Marine Corps. From being broken down and built back up on Parris Island (and being the parent of a child undergoing that experience), to the growth of both father and son and their separate reevaluations of what it means to serve. From Frank’s realization that among his fellow soccer dads “the very words ‘boot camp’ were pejorative, conjuring up ‘troubled youths at risk’ “ to John’s learning that “the Marine next to you is more important than you are,” Keeping Faith is a fascinating and personal reconsideration of issues of class, duty, and patriotism. But as John and his fellow recruits battle to make the cut—and John’s family struggles to deal with the worry and separation, it is also an extremely timely, moving, and wonderfully written human interest story—a moving chronicle of love, duty and patriotism in contemporary America. “Beautifully written ... great insight and unselfconscious humor.”—Publishers Weekly"," Biography & Autobiography , Military",Carroll & Graf,"Thursday, August 1, 2002",0,0
55510,Encyclopedia of Southern Culture,"By Wilson, Charles Reagan and Ferris, William","The American South is a geographical entity, a historical fact, a place in the imagination, and the homeland of an array of Americans who consider themselves southerners.  The region is often shrouded in romance and myth, but its realities are as intriguing, as intricate, as its legends.The Encyclopedia of Southern Culture is ""the first attempt ever"" notes U.S. News & World Report, ""to describe every aspect of a region's life and thought, the impact of its history and policies, its music and literature, its manners and myths, even the iced tea that washes down its catfish and cornbread.""There are many Souths, many southerners.  The region's fundamental uniqueness, in fact, lies in its peculiar combination of cultural traits, a somewhat curious, often elusive blend created by blacks and whites who have lived together for more than 300 years.  In telling their stories, the Encyclopedia of Southern Culture ranges from grand historical themes to the whimsical; from the arts and high culture (William Faulkner and Leontyne Price) to folk culture (quilts, banjos, and grits) to popular culture (Gilley's and Gone With the Wind).The Encyclopedia's definition of the South is a cultural one: the South is found wherever southern culture is found.  Although the focus is on the eleven states of the former Confederacy, this volume also encompasses southern outposts in midwestern and middle-Atlantic border states, even the southern pockets of Chicago, Detroit, and Bakersfield.To foster a deeper understanding of the South's cultural patterns, the editors have organized this reference book around twenty-four thematic sections, including history, religion, folklore, language, art and architecture, recreation, politics, the mythic South, urbanization, literature, music, violence, law, and media.  The life experiences of southerners are discussed in sections on black life, ethnic life, and women's life.  Throughout, the broad goal is to identify the forces that have supported either the reality or the illusion of the southern way of life -- people, places, ideas, institutions, events, symbols, rituals, and values.The Encyclopedia of Southern Culture was developed by the Center for the Study of Southern Culture at the University of Mississippi. Contributors to the volume include historians, literary critics, sociologists, anthropologists, geographers, linguists, theologians, folklorists, architects, ecologists, lawyers, university presidents, newspaper reporters, magazine writers, and novelists."," Reference , Encyclopedias",The University of North Carolina Press,"Friday, September 1, 1989",0,0

56914,A Letter to America,"By Boren, David","A powerful wake-up call to all AmericansWith only 6 percent of the world’s population, how long will the United States remain a global superpower? The answer, David Boren tells us in A Letter to America, depends on asking ourselves tough questions. A powerful wake-up call to Americans, A Letter to America, forces us to take a bold, objective look at ourselves.In A Letter to America, Boren explains with unsparing clarity why the country is at a crossroads and why decisive action is urgently needed and offers us an ambitious, hopeful plan.What the country needs, Boren asserts, are major reforms to restore the ability of our political system to act responsibly. By relying on our shared values, we can replace cynicism with hope and strengthen our determination to build a better future. We must fashion a post–Cold War foreign policy that fits twenty-first-century realities—including multiple contending superpowers. We must adopt campaign finance reform that curbs the influence of special interests and restores political power to the voters.

This anthology includes poems from the first book by each of the 92 winners of the annual Younger Poets contest.The selections are accompanied by an introduction by George Bradley, the 1986 winner of the contest. Bradley charts the course of the series under the aegis of such contest judges as Stephen Vincent Benét, W. H. Auden, and James Merrill, lacing his narrative with anecdotes about the judges and winners. He also establishes the series’ vital role in the development of American poetry and American publishing. The anthology is divided into two sections: ""The Early Years,"" which briefly presents the first 31 winners of the contest, and ""The Modern Series,"" which gives ample room to display the early work of some of America's finest poets. All poets are introduced by a biographical headnote, and in the second section Bradley has added a brief commentary directing the reader to the salient features of each poet's work."," Poetry , Anthologies (multiple authors)",Yale University Press,"Sunday, March 1, 1998",0,0

After learning that one of his great aunt’s beloved and rare white bulldogs has been poisoned, the Orthodox bishop knows there is only one detective clever enough to investigate the murder: Sister Pelagia.The bespectacled, freckled Pelagia is lively, curious, extraordinarily clumsy, and persistent. At the estate in question, she finds a whole host of suspects, any one of whom might have benefited if the old lady (who changes her will at whim) had expired of grief at the pooch’s demise. There’s Pyotr, the matron’s grandson, a nihilist with a grudge who has fallen for the maid; Stepan, the penniless caretaker, who has sacrificed his youth to the care of the estate; Miss Wrigley, a mysterious Englishwoman who has recently been named sole heiress to the fortune; Poggio, an opportunistic and freeloading “artistic” photographer; and, most intriguingly, Naina, the old lady’s granddaughter, a girl so beautiful she could drive any man to do almost anything.As Pelagia bumbles and intuits her way to the heart of a mystery among people with faith only in greed and desire, she must bear in mind the words of Saint Paul: “Beware of dogs–and beware of evil-doers.”“Critics on both sides of the Atlantic have praised [Akunin’s] clever plots, vivid characters and wit.”–Baltimore Sun“Akunin’s wonderful novels are always intricately webbed and plotted.”–The Providence Journal"," Fiction , Mystery & Detective , General",Random House Trade Paperbacks,"Monday, January 1, 2007",0,0

She knew almost nothing of the changed world to which she was returning, and she was tormented by panic attacks and inexplicable seizures.Armstrong’s struggle against despair was further fueled by a string of discouragements—failed spirituality, doctorate, and jobs; fruitless dealings with psychiatrists. Finally, in 1976, she was diagnosed with epilepsy, given proper treatment, and released from her “private hell.” She then began the writing career that would become her true calling, and as she focused on the sacred texts of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, her own inner story began to emerge. Without realizing it, she had embarked on a spiritual quest, and through it she would eventually experience moments of transcendence—the profound fulfillment that she had not found in long hours of prayer as a young nun.Powerfully engaging, often heartbreaking, but lit with bursts of humor, The Spiral Staircase is an extraordinary history of self."," Biography & Autobiography , Religious",Knopf,"Monday, March 1, 2004",0,0
54551,The Secular Mind,"By Coles, Robert","Does the business of daily living distance us from life's mysteries? Do most Americans value spiritual thinking more as a hobby than as an all-encompassing approach to life? Will the concept of the soul be defunct after the next few generations? Child psychiatrist and best-selling author Robert Coles offers a profound meditation on how secular culture has settled into the hearts and minds of Americans. This book is a sweeping essay on the shift from religious control over Western society to the scientific dominance of the mind. Interwoven into the story is Coles's personal quest for understanding how the sense of the sacred has stood firm in the lives of individuals--both the famous and everyday people whom he has known--even as they have struggled with doubt. As a student, Coles questioned Paul Tillich on the meaning of the ""secular mind,"" and his fascination with the perceived opposition between secular and sacred intensified over the years. This book recounts conversations Coles has had with such figures as Anna Freud, Karen Horney, William Carlos Williams, Walker Percy, and Dorothy Day. Their words dramatize the frustration and the joy of living in both the secular and sacred realms. Coles masterfully draws on a variety of literary sources that trace the relationship of the sacred and the secular: the stories of Abraham and Moses, the writings of St. Paul, Augustine, Kierkegaard, Darwin, and Freud, and the fiction of George Eliot, Hardy, Meredith, Flannery O'Connor, and Huxley. Ever since biblical times, Coles shows us, the relationship between these two realms has thrived on conflict and accommodation. Coles also notes that psychoanalysis was first viewed as a rival to religion in terms of getting a handle on inner truths. He provocatively demonstrates how psychoanalysis has either been incorporated into the thinking of many religious denominations or become a type of religion in itself. How will people in the next millennium deal with advances in chemistry and neurology? Will these sciences surpass psychoanalysis in controlling how we think and feel? This book is for anyone who has wondered about the fate of the soul and our ability to seek out the sacred in our constantly changing world."," Religion , Christian Theology , General",Princeton University Press,"Monday, March 1, 1999",0,0

Now, she's all grown up, and a knockout of a medical student who's arousing some not-so-sisterly feelings in the brothers.When one of them acts on those feelings, they will all - including Erika - discover how far they're willing to go in the name of friendship, loyalty, and love. For seeing Erika in this new light has some disturbing consequences: it gives the guys an eye-opening dose of the double standard they so casually apply to the women in their lives, and the not-so-gentle-manly way they treat their supposedly special ladies. Could their adorable little sister cause such a crisis and be the catalyst for such change?

16754,The Next Agenda: Blueprint For A New Progressive Movement,"By Borosage, Robert L. (EDT) and Hickey, Roger (EDT)","In The Next Agenda, editors Robert Borosage and Roger Hickey of the Campaign for America's Future have gathered essays written by some of America's most progressive thinkers and activists that lay out ideas and reforms to address the serious issues facing us today. They argue that the economic prosperity of the last decade can only be sustained if it is more widely shared. And they call for a new progressive movement to forge new rules for the global economy just as the Progressives of the last century tamed the excesses of America's national economy.Each of the fourteen essays in The Next Agenda detail the context that makes fundamental reform both necessary and possible and outlines the policy proposals that are vital to begin meeting the challenge. David Moberg, reporter for In These Times, writes about reforming labor law to empower workers whose voices have been drowned out by globalization. Richard Rothstein, education columnist for the New York Times, writes of the growing shortage of classrooms and teachers and suggests reform initiatives for public education. Ted Marmor of the Yale School of Management, and Jon Oberlander, of the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, provide a plan to make affordable, comprehensive health care available to everyone. Carl Pope of The Sierra Club and a leader of the environmental movement joins with labor leader Robert Wages, of PACE International, to lay out elements of a Green Growth agenda, detailing how labor and environmentalists can combine in promoting sensible investments for sustainable growth. These forward-thinking essays serve as a springboard for national debate and provide an ambitious agenda for the next administration."," Political Science , Public Policy , General",Routledge,"Monday, January 1, 2001",0,0

In The Hope, his long-awaited return to historical fiction, he turns to one of the most thrilling stories of our time - the saga of Israel.In the grand, epic style of The Winds of War and War and Remembrance, The Hope plunges the reader into the major battles, the disasters and victories, and the fragile periods of peace from the 1948 War of Independence to the astounding triumph of the Six-Day War in 1967. And since Israelis have seen their share of comic mishaps as well as heroism, this novel offers some of Herman Wouk's most amusing scenes since the famed ""strawberry business"" in The Caine Mutiny.First to last The Hope is a tale of four Israeli army officers and the women they love: Zev Barak, Viennese-born cultured military man; Benny Luria, ace fighter pilot with religious stirrings; Sam Pasternak, sardonic and mysterious Mossad man; and an antic dashing warrior they call Kishote, Hebrew for Quixote, who arrives at Israel's first pitched battle a refugee boy on a mule and over the years rises to high rank. In the love stories of these four men, the author of Marjorie Morningstar has created a gallery of three memorable Israeli women and one quirky fascinating American, daughter of a high CIA official and headmistress of a Washington girls school.With the authenticity, authority, and narrative force of Wouk's finest fiction, The Hope portrays not so much the victory of one people over another, as the gallantry of the human spirit, surviving and triumphing against crushing odds. In that sense it can be called a tale of hope for all mankind; a note that Herman Wouk has struck in all his writings, against the prevailing pessimism of our turbulent century."," Fiction , General","Little, Brown and Company","Wednesday, December 1, 1993",0,0

16446,For Your Own Good: Hidden Cruelty in Child-Rearing and the Roots of Violence.,"By Miller, Alice","For Your Own Good, the contemporary classic exploring the serious if not gravely dangerous consequences parental cruelty can bring to bear on children everywhere, is one of the central works by Alice Miller, the celebrated Swiss psychoanalyst.With her typically lucid, strong, and poetic language, Miller investigates the personal stories and case histories of various self-destructive and/or violent individuals to expand on her theories about the long-term affects of abusive child-rearing. Her conclusions—on what sort of parenting can create a drug addict, or a murderer, or a Hitler—offer much insight, and make a good deal of sense, while also straying far from psychoanalytic dogma about human nature, which Miller vehemently rejects.This important study paints a shocking picture of the violent world—indeed, of the ever-more-violent world—that each generation helps to create when traditional upbringing, with its hidden cruelty, is perpetuated. The book also presents readers with useful solutions in this regard—namely, to resensitize the victimized child who has been trapped within the adult, and to unlock the emotional life that has been frozen in repression."," Psychology , Developmental , Child","Farrar, Straus and Giroux","Sunday, January 1, 1989",0,0

Pelton soon embarked on a globe-spanning odyssey to penetrate and understand this shadowy world, ultimately delivering stunning insights into the way private soldiers are used.Enter a blood-soaked world of South African mercenaries and tribal fighters backed by ruthless financiers. Drop into Baghdad’s Green Zone, strap on body armor, and take a daily high-speed ride with a doomed crew of security contractors who dodge car bombs and snipers just to get their charges to the airport. Share a drink in a chic hotel bar with wealthy owners of private armies who debate the best way to stay alive in war zones.Licensed to Kill spans four continents and three years, taking us inside the CIA’s dirty wars; the brutal contractor murders in Fallujah and the Alamo-like sieges in Najaf and Al Kut; the Deep South contractor training camps where ex–Special Operations soldiers and even small town cops learn the ropes; the contractor conventions where macho attendees swap bullet-punctuated tales and discuss upcoming gigs; and the grim Central African prison where contractors turned failed mercenaries pay a steep price.The United States has encouraged the use of the private sector in all facets of the War on Terror, placing contractors outside the bounds of functional legal constraints. With the shocking clarity that can come only from firsthand observation, Licensed to Kill painstakingly deconstructs the most controversial events and introduces the pivotal players. Most disturbingly, it shows that there are indeed thousands of contractors—with hundreds more being produced every month—who’ve been given a license to kill, their services available to the highest bidder."," Political Science , Terrorism",Crown,"Wednesday, August 1, 2007",0,0

They warn that the possibility of creating stable illiberal government, much less a liberal democracy is near impossible and that U.S. troops risk becoming embroiled in a wider regional conflict.
